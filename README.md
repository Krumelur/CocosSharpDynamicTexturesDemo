CocosSharp Hills Demo
===================

This repository uses [CocosSharp](https://github.com/mono/CocosSharp) to render a landscape as seen in the famous game TinyWings.

It demonstrates how to:

* Create textures dynamically
*  Render a smooth hills scenery
* Texture the scenery seamlessly using CCGeometryBatch
* Changing the texture on-the-fly

The project runs on iOS and Android.
